## Analysis and Visualization of Global Renewable Energy Trends

### Objective 

- To analyze global renewable energy data and identify trends
- To visualize the growth rate of different renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydroelectric) in various countries
- To highlight challenges and opportunities in renewable energy adoption globally


### Introduction 
In the face of escalating climate change and energy security concerns, adopting renewable energy sources is crucial for sustainable development. This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global renewable energy trends using various datasets on production, consumption, and investments. The analysis spans from 2000 to 2022, providing insights into the growth of renewable energy, regional disparities, and the impact on global economies

### Data Collection 
The primary data sources used in this project include:
1. **OWID (Our World in Data) Energy Dataset**: This dataset provided comprehensive information on global energy consumption and production across various renewable sources
2. **Investment Data**: Additional data on financial investments in renewable energy technologies and infrastructure were sourced from publicly available datasets

The datasets covered: 

### Approach 

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from international databases on renewable energy production, consumption, and investments
2. **Data Cleaning**: Streamlined the dataset by removing non-renewable energy columns and imputing missing values using median for numerical and mode for categorical columns


### Data Analysis 
The analysis included various statistical and visualization techniques to extract insights from the data:
  - **Box Plots**: Used to visualize data distribution and identify outliers in key numerical variables.
  - **Trend Analysis**: Time series analysis to identify trends in renewable energy consumption and production from 2000 to 2022.
  - **Correlation Analysis**: Heatmaps were used to visualize the correlation between different renewable energy sources.
  - **Geospatial Analysis**: Choropleth maps were used to highlight regional disparities in renewable energy consumption, production, and adoption.

### Visualization
A range of visualizations was created to effectively communicate the insights gained from the analysis:
- **Line Graphs**: Depicting trends in renewable energy consumption over time.
- **Bar Charts**: Comparing renewable energy consumption and production by country.
- **Pie Charts**: Showing the share of different renewable energy sources in the overall energy mix.
- **Box Plots**: Visualizing the distribution and outliers of key renewable energy variables.
- **Choropleth Maps**: Highlighting regional disparities in renewable energy adoption.
